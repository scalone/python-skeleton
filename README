Python Skeleton Project

Whenever you feel the itch to start a project, this should help you get organized and take care of some of the yak shaving.

Get these packages:

1. pip from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

2. distribute from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute

3. nose from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/

4. virtualenv from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv


# TODO
- update setup.py to latest version
- make renamer into a callable bin script
